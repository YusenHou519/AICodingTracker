### üìÅ Selective Folder Monitoring
- Choose specific folders to monitor on first run
- Focuses monitoring on designated work directories
- Avoids tracking unnecessary files

### üíæ Automatic Save Management
- Automatically enables VS Code's AutoSave feature
- Forces 3-second save intervals for consistent monitoring
- Ensures all code changes are captured

### üìä Real-time Status Display
- Status bar indicator showing monitoring status
- Quick access to extension information
- Visual feedback on detected AI extensions

## Installation

1. Install the extension through VS Code Extension Marketplace (when published)
2. Or install from VSIX file: `code --install-extension aicodingtracker-0.0.3.vsix`

## Usage

1. **First Run Setup**: The extension will automatically prompt you to select a folder to monitor
2. **Status Monitoring**: Check the status bar for real-time monitoring information
3. **Manual Commands**: Use the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P`) to access:
   - `AI Coding Tracker: Select Monitor Folder` - Choose/change monitored folder
   - `AI Coding Tracker: Show Status` - Display detailed status information

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `aiCodingTracker.enabled`: Enable/disable the extension
* `aiCodingTracker.monitoredFolder`: Path to the monitored folder
* `aiCodingTracker.serverEndpoint`: Server API endpoint for data reporting
* `aiCodingTracker.apiToken`: API authentication token
* `aiCodingTracker.reportInterval`: Report interval in milliseconds (default: 5 minutes)
* `aiCodingTracker.alertThreshold`: Alert threshold for line count increase
* `aiCodingTracker.enableRealTimeAlert`: Enable real-time alerts
* `aiCodingTracker.aiScanInterval`: AI plugin scan interval in milliseconds (default: 300000ms/5 minutes)

## Current Status

This extension is **production-ready** for monitoring and detection features. Currently implemented features:

### ‚úÖ Fully Implemented (v0.0.3)
- **AI Extension Detection**: 25+ AI tools, automatic 5-minute scanning
- **Folder Selection and Configuration**: Interactive setup and persistent storage
- **AutoSave Management**: Forced 3-second intervals with workspace configuration
- **Status Bar Integration**: Real-time monitoring status and quick access
- **Code Change Monitoring**: Complete real-time tracking with snapshot storage
- **Anomaly Detection**: Advanced algorithms for suspicious activity detection
- **Alert System**: Multi-level warnings with detailed change analysis
- **Data Persistence**: Comprehensive snapshot management with memory optimization

### üöß In Development
- **Server Reporting (Phase 3)**: HTTP API integration and data upload

## Known Issues

- **Server reporting functionality pending** (Phase 3 - HTTP API integration)
- **Network connectivity detection** not yet implemented for offline scenarios
- **Batch data upload mechanism** requires development for efficiency
- **Advanced machine learning algorithms** could enhance detection accuracy further

### Performance Notes
- Extension is optimized for codebases up to 10,000 files
- Memory usage optimized with automatic cleanup and content truncation
- Snapshot storage limited to 7-day retention for performance
